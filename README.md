#jQuery Tutorial
===

## background
jQuery is a feature-rich JavaScript library created by John Resig in 2006 with the purpose of making JavaScript easier to use.
Hence the motto of: **_Write less, do more._**
It does not replace JavaScript (the code you write in jQuery is still JavaScript), but it does simplify tasks by
writing less code.
Here are some the important core features supported by jQuery:
..*DOM manipulation
..*Effects
The great thing about jQuery is the number of plug-ins or libraries available that you can leverage.  

## ways to implement in your site
1. Access the jQuery core libraries:
    * there are a few ways to do this. You can download the compressed and uncompressed files. jQuery has opinions on which files are better for which purposes.
    You can find out more about that here: [jQuery downloads] (http://jquery.com/download/).
    *
1. Link to jQuery library through your HTML file:
    * First you want to link to the jQuery core library through a script tag in your HTML file.
    ```
    <script src="jquery.js"></script>
    ```
    The src attribute in the <script> element must point to a copy of jQuery.
