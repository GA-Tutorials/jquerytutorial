## background

## ways to implement in your site
1. Access the jQuery core libraries:
    * there are a few ways to do this. You can download the compressed and uncompressed files. jQuery has opinions on which files are better for which purposes.
    You can find out more about that here: [jQuery downloads] (http://jquery.com/download/).
    * CDN
1. Link to jQuery library through your HTML file:
    * First you want to link to the jQuery core library through a script tag in your HTML file.
    if you downloaded:
    ```
    <script src="jquery.js"></script>
    ```
    if you used a CDN:
    ```
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    ```

    The src attribute in the <script> element must point to a copy of jQuery.
